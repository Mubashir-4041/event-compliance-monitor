## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Blank Dashboard or Loading Forever?

3. **Restart the dev server**:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   ```

### "Failed to fetch events" Error?

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify your PredictHQ API token is valid
3. Test the API directly: http://localhost:3000/api/events

### No Events Showing?

- The query might not match any current events
- Try different parameters (see Customization section above)
- Check if PredictHQ has events for your query

3. **Mark events as licensed** by clicking the toggle in event details
