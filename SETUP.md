  accent: "#1ED8FB",      // Accent color (cyan)
}

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The optimized production build will be created in `.next` folder.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Dependencies not installing
- Solution: Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again

**Issue**: Port 3000 already in use
- Solution: Kill the process using port 3000 or run on different port:
  ```bash
  npm run dev -- -p 3001
  ```

**Issue**: Styling not loading
- Solution: Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured and restart dev server
