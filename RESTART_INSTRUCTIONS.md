## ✅ What You Should See After Restart:

In the terminal logs, you should now see:
```
🔑 API Token present: true
🔑 Token length: 45
🌐 Fetching from: https://api.predicthq.com/v1/events...
📡 PredictHQ Response Status: 200 OK
✅ Successfully fetched: 3691 events
```

And in your browser:
- Beautiful dashboard with 50 real events
- Event names, venues, dates, locations
- Working table and map views
- No errors!

## 🚨 Why This is Necessary:

Next.js loads environment variables **ONLY when it starts**.

If you create or modify `.env.local` while the server is running, you **MUST restart** for changes to take effect.
