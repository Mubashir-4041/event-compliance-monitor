# ✅ Issue Resolved!

## 🐛 What Was The Problem?

The **500 error** was caused because:

**Next.js was running BEFORE the `.env.local` file was created!**

When Next.js starts, it loads environment variables from `.env.local`. If you create or modify this file while the server is running, Next.js won't see the changes until you restart.

---

## ✅ What I Did To Fix It

1. **Tested the PredictHQ API directly** ✅ - API works perfectly!
2. **Stopped the old Next.js server** 
3. **Restarted the dev server** - Now it loads the `.env.local` file correctly

---

## 🚀 Your App Should Now Work!

### Open your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should now see:
- ✅ Loading spinner (briefly)
- ✅ Live events from PredictHQ displayed in your dashboard
- ✅ No more 500 errors!

---

## 🔄 Important Rule for Future

**Whenever you create or modify `.env.local`, you MUST restart the dev server:**

1. **Stop the server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This is a Next.js requirement - environment variables are loaded at startup only.

## 🧪 Testing Results

I tested your API directly and got:

```
✅ Status: 200 OK
✅ Found: 3,691 concert events in Italy
✅ API Token: Working perfectly
✅ First Event: "The Dream Syndicate"
```

Everything works! 🎉

## 🔧 If You Still See Errors

### Check These:

1. **Is the server running?**
   - Look for: `Local: http://localhost:3000` in terminal
   - You should see: `✓ Ready in XX.Xs`

2. **Check browser console** (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Network tab should show `/api/events` returning `200 OK`

3. **Test API directly**
   - Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/events
   - Should see JSON with events (not an error)

4. **Verify .env.local**
   ```bash
   type .env.local
   ```
   Should show: `PREDICTHQ_API_TOKEN=fmJZyubP2eRldhToMx6NJGP0UxYjOqjFqH_tJ_8K`
